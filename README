Description
===========

jamman-tools is a python script collection aimed at producing music very quickly using the JamMan loop sequencer by DigiTech.

Workflow
========

1) plug the jamman to your computer
2) create a new directory, in which you copy the samples directories as is
3) enter the directory (cd)
4) jamman_all will generate a generic preview
5) eventually use jamman_sequence to define the merging sequence

Of course it is possible to prevent using the sequencer at all by doing it on the jamman itself (i.e. copy slot 10 to 11)

Scripts
=======

* jamman_extract 

Will move and rename the wav loop files to the root project directory

* jamman_sequence 

Will let you define the rendering sequence

* jamman_render 

Will then render the project

* jamman_compress 

Will produce mp3 & Flac versions of the file to an 'encoded' subdir

* jamman_export 

Will recursively copy all of the mp3 version of a directory structure to an "exported" directory in the current path

* jamman_clean 

Will remove temporary files

TODO
====

 * packaging/installer
 * option parsing
 * jamman_sync or jamman_import
